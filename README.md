This module provides the shared codebase between Solr
and potentially any future search engines.

This module on its own does not do much, and unless you are planning on building
another search engine support, there is no reason to install it.

## Installation

`composer require firesphere/searchbackend`

## Search engines

- Solr: `firesphere/solr-search`

# Interfaces:

- QueryBuilderInterface
- SearchResultInterface
- SiteStateInterface

## Solr?

Yeah, I have to refactor it still, but the concepts are the same.

# Cow?

Cow!

// @todo Firesphere needs to get some sponsor logos (And maybe some sponsors?)
